# Description {#description}

What are things we want to describe in political science?

-   Unemployment rate, GDP
-   Voter turnout, vote share for a party in an election
-   Percentage of women in the labor force
-   Poverty rates over time

What else? What does description help us achieve?

-   Identify tendencies
-   Identify patterns or trends
-   Identify relationships between two or more factors
-   Help us generalize from anecdotes, what is common vs. what is uncommon?
-   Diagnose demand, needs, potential problems, likely outcomes

Generate ideas for other goals, such as explanation and prediction

## Process of Describing

How do we go about a descriptive quantitative analysis?

1.  Substantive Expertise: Start with a topic, puzzle, or question (e.g., How is the economy doing?)
2.  Find outcome data relevant to that question (e.g., GDP)
    -   Start from a concept: what we want to describe (i.e., health of the economy)
    -   Move toward an "operationalization" (i.e., a way to measure it)
    -   Easy! except... social science is messy. Our concepts are rich, while our measures may be very narrow or concrete.
        -   For example, GDP is one way to measure economic health, but is it the only measure?
        -   Choose measures based on validity, reliability, cost
3.  Find multiple relevant units or "data points"
    -   E.g., Multiple years of data (e.g., U.S., from 1900 to 2020)
    -   E.g., Multiple countries from one year (e.g., U.S. to Germany to other countries)
4.  Summarize the data to help answer the question

### Example Process

1.  How is the economy doing?
2.  Find outcome data relevant to that question
    -   Let's ask people
3.  Find multiple relevant units or data points
    -   We will ask several people. Each person will be a data point.
4.  Summarize the data
    -   Let's take the mean

How would you summarize information in explaining it to another person? You would probably want to describe how most people feel about the economy. In other words, you would describe the "central tendency" of people's responses (the central tendency of the data).

## Summarizing univariate data

For a video explainer of the code in this section, see below. The video only discusses the code. Use the notes and lecture discussion for additional context. (Via youtube, you can speed up the playback to 1.5 or 2x speed.)

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library("vembedr")
library(knitr)

```

Univariate data refers to data coming from one "variable," where a variable captures the values of a changing characteristic.

Our set of values is Outcome = {0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1}.

-   We will call this a vector of values, where a vector is just a collection of things.
-   Because our vector contains only numbers, we will call it a *numeric* vector.
-   Each value can be indexed by `i`, denoting the position of the value in the
-   For example, Jesse is in position `i=10` of the vector, and his value is 1

We can create vectors in R by using `c()` and assigning `<-` it to an object we will call `Outcome`.

```{r}
Outcome <- c(0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1) # Use commas to separate values
```

We can extract a particular value within our vector using brackets

```{r}
Outcome[10]
```

We can label our outcomes using `names()`

```{r}
names(Outcome) <-c("Joe","Sally", "Trevor", "Emily", "Mark",
                   "Sarah Jane", "Stacey", "Steve", "Phoebe", "Jesse")
Outcome[10]
```

We can overwrite whole vectors or values within a vector

```{r}
Outcome <- c(5,0,2, 6,1,1, 7, 8, 0, 1) # oops we put the wrong numbers
Outcome
Outcome <- c(0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1) # no problem, just overwrite it
Outcome
```

Oops we accidentally type a 0 for Jesse.

```{r}
Outcome <- c(0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0) # oops typo for Jesse
Outcome
Outcome[10] <- 1 # no prob bob. Assign a 1 in position 10
Outcome
```

Vectors do not have to be numeric. Character vectors contain a collection of words and phrases. In R, we use quotations around character values

Example: let's create a vector of names that we will call `People`.

```{r}
People <- c("Joe","Sally", "Trevor", "Emily", "Mark", "Sarah Jane", "Stacey", "Steve", "Phoebe", "Jesse")
People[10]
```

We can use the R function `class()` to tell us the type of object we have.

```{r}
class(Outcome)
class(People)
```

## Functions to summarize univariate data

For univariate data, often we are interested in describing the range of the values and their central tendency.

-   range: the minimum (`min()`) and maximum (`max()`) values
-   mean: the average value (`mean()`)

The average is the sum of the values divided by the number of values:

$\bar{X} = \frac{\text{sum of values}}{\text{number of values}} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_N}{N}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{i=N} x_i$

Let's do this in R for our set of 10 values

```{r}
(0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1)/10
```

The average outcome is .4. Note: when a variable contains only 0's and 1's its mean is the proportion of 1's. 40% of people think the economy is doing well.

### Using functions in R (overview)

A function is an action(s) that you request R to perform on an object or set of objects. For example, we will use the `mean()` function to ask R to take the mean or "average" of a vector.

-   Inside the function you place inputs or "arguments."

```{r}
mean(Outcome)
```

R also has functions that take the sum `sum()` of a vector of values.

```{r}
sumofvalues <- sum(Outcome)
```

And that count the total number of values or "length" `length()` of the vector.

```{r}
numberofvalues <- length(Outcome)
```

Note that the below is also equivalent to the mean

```{r}
sumofvalues / numberofvalues
```

Returning to our example, we found that 40% of people surveyed thought the economy was doing well. Surveying people about their opinions on how the country doing is a common way that social scientists use description. We could extend this exercise in many ways going forward, even with the same question.

-   Start with a question: How is the economy doing?
-   Let's find a measure: Ask people if the economy is doing well.
-   Find data points: Multiple people (we could stop there with the average!), or add more variables:
    -   Across time: Survey people across multiple years
    -   Across type of people: Survey different partisan groups

These types of survey trends are often used by news organizations and public opinion organizations like, Gallup.

This was just a first example of description in political science. There are many other ways to describe how the economy is doing and many other topics we might want to describe in politics.

## Loading data into R

For this section, our motivating example will be methods to measure voter turnout in the United States.

Describing voter turnout

-   What is a typical level of voter turnout?
-   How has turnout changed over time?
-   Is turnout higher in presidential years or in midterm years?

How can we measure turnout? Think about the validity, reliability, and cost of different approaches.

Example: Dataset on Voter Turnout in the U.S. across multiple years

![](images/turnoutframe.png){width="80%"}

In this dataset, each row is an election year. Each column contains information about the population, potential voters, or voter turnout. These will help us compute the turnout rate in a given year. To work with this dataset, we need to load it into R.

### Working with datasets in R

For a video explainer of the code in this section, see below. The video only discusses the code. Use the notes and lecture discussion for additional context. (Via youtube, you can speed up the playback to 1.5 or 2x speed.)

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library("vembedr")
library(knitr)

embed_url("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rm_g0rrglEQ")
```

Often the variables we care about are stored inside of rectangular datasets

-   These have a number of rows `nrow()` and columns `ncol()`
-   Each row is an "observation," representing the information collected from an individual or entity
-   Each column is a variable, representing a changing characteristic across multiple observations

When we import a dataset into R, we have a few options.

Option 1: Download dataset to your computer

-   Move the dataset to your working directory
-   Identify the file type (e.g., csv, dta, RData, txt)
-   Pick the appropriate R function to match the type (e.g., `read.csv(), read.dta(), load(), read.table()`)
-   Assign the dataset to an object. This object will now be `class()` of `data.frame`

```{r, eval=F}
turnout <- read.csv("turnout.csv")
```

Option 2: Read file from a url provided

-   Need an active internet connection for this to work
-   URL generally must be public
-   Include the url inside the function used to read the data

```{r}
turnout <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ktmccabe/teachingdata/main/turnout.csv")
```

```{r}
class(turnout)
```

You can also open up a window to view the data:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
View(turnout)
```

### Measuring the Turnout in the US Elections

Relevant questions with voter turnout

-   What is a typical level of voter turnout?
-   Is turnout higher in presidential years or in midterm years?
-   Is turnout higher or lower based on voting-eligible (VEP) or voting-age (VAP) populations? We have a lot of people who are citizens 18 and older who are ineligible to vote. This makes the VEP denominator smaller than the VAP.

Voter Turnout in the U.S.

-   Numerator: `total`: Total votes cast (in thousands)
-   Denominator:
    -   VAP: (voting-age population) from Census
    -   VEP (voting-eligible population) VEP = VAP + overseas voters - ineligible voters
-   Additional Variables and Descriptions
    -   `year`: election year
    -   `ANES`: ANES self-reported estimated turnout rate
    -   `VEP`: Voting Eligible Population (in thousands)
    -   `VAP`: Voting Age Population (in thousands)
    -   `total`: total ballots cast for highest office (in thousands)
    -   `felons`: total ineligible felons (in thousands)
    -   `noncitizens`: total non-citizens (in thousands)
    -   `overseas`: total eligible overseas voters (in thousands)
    -   `osvoters`: total ballots counted by overseas voters (in thousands)

### Getting to know your data

```{r}
## How many observations (the rows)?
nrow(turnout)

## How many variables (the columns)?
ncol(turnout)

## What are the variable names?
names(turnout)

## Show the first six rows
head(turnout)
```

Extract a particular column (vector) from the data using the \$.

```{r}
turnout$year
```

Extract the 10th year. Just like before! We use 10 to indicate the value of the `year` column in position (row 10) of the data.

```{r}
turnout$year[10]
```

We can take the `mean()` of a particular column, too. Let's take it of the total number of voters.

```{r}
mean(turnout$total)
```

And get the `class()` (Note: integer is just a type of numeric variable)

```{r}
class(turnout$total)
```

We can also use brackets in the full data frame, but because our data frame has BOTH rows and columns, we cannot just supply one position `i`. Instead, we have to tell R which row AND which column by using a comma between the positions.

```{r}
turnout[1,2] # value in row 1, column 2
```

We can use the column name instead

```{r}
turnout[1, "VEP"]
```

If we leave the second entry blank, it will return all columns for the specified row

```{r}
turnout[1,] # All variable values for row 1
```

The opposite is true if we leave the first entry blank.

```{r}
turnout[,2] # VEP for all rows
```

## Comparing VEP and VAP turnout

### Creating new variables in R

Let's create a new variable that is VAP that adds overseas voters.

```{r}
# Use $ to add a new variable (i.e., column) to a dataframe
turnout$VAPplusoverseas <- turnout$VAP + turnout$overseas
```

Under the hood, what this is doing is taking each value of `turnout$VAP` and adding it to its corresponding values of `turnout$overseas`.

And, yes, this new variable shows up as a new column in `turnout`. Go ahead, `View()` it

```{r, eval=F}
View(turnout)
```

This does not change the underlying `turnout.csv` file, only the `turnout data.frame` we are working with in the current R session.

-   This is an advantage of using an R script.
-   You don't have to worry about overwriting/messing up the raw data.
-   You start from the original raw data when you load `turnout.csv`, and then everything else is done within R.

This is our new denominator. Now we can calculate turnout based on this denominator.

```{r}
turnout$newVAPturnout <- turnout$total / turnout$VAPplusoverseas
```

Just like with adding two vectors, when we divide, each value in the first vector is divided by its corresponding value in the second vector.

```{r}
turnout$newVAPturnout
```

Let's calculate the VEP turnout rate and turn it into a percentage. This time, we do it in one step.

-   (total votes / VEP) $\times$ 100:

```{r}
turnout$newVEPturnout <- (turnout$total / turnout$VEP) * 100
turnout$newVEPturnout
```

Let's change it from a proportion to a percentage. How? Multiply each value of `turnout$newVAP` by 100

```{r}
turnout$newVAPturnout <- turnout$newVAPturnout * 100
```

This multiplies each number within the vector by 100.

```{r}
turnout$newVAPturnout
```

What is typical turnout?

```{r}
mean(turnout$newVAPturnout)

mean(turnout$newVEPturnout)
```

We find that turnout based on the voting age population is lower than turnout based on the voting eligible population. This is a pattern that political scientists have examined, going back several decades. For example, in a 2001 article McDonald and Popkin show that is it the ineligible population that grew from the 1970s onward and not the population of people who simply prefer not to vote. (See more [here](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3117725).)

## Comparing Presidential vs. Midterm turnout

How does turnout compare in presidential vs. midterm years? Sometimes using a single summary of turnout may obscure important underlying differences in the data. To detect these differences, we may want to summarize different parts of the data.

Oh dear. We need to extract specific years from the turnout data frame. Which rows contain the years we want?

```{r}
turnout$year
```

Ok: rows 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,14 are the presidential. And rows 2,4,6,8,10,12 are midterms.

```{r}
## we can extract all of these at once by using c()
turnout$year[c(1,3,5,7,9,11,13,14)] # presidential
```

Let's take the mean VEP turnout for presidential years.

```{r}
mean(turnout$newVEPturnout[c(1,3,5,7,9,11,13,14)])
```

Let's take the mean VEP turnout for midterm years.

```{r}
mean(turnout$newVEPturnout[c(2,4,6,8,10,12)])
```

Let's take the difference by storing each mean and then subtracting

```{r}
mean.VEP.pres <- mean(turnout$newVEPturnout[c(1,3,5,7,9,11,13,14)])
mean.VEP.mid <- mean(turnout$newVEPturnout[c(2,4,6,8,10,12)])
mean.VEP.pres -  mean.VEP.mid
```

Presidential turnout, on average, is higher than midterm turnout.

### R shortcut for writing vectors

Sometimes we write numbers that are in a predictable sequence (e.g., 1,2,3,4,5). In R, we have functions that prevent us from having to type each number when this is the case.

```{r}
c(1,2,3,4,5) # is equivalent to:
1:5 # is equivalent to:
seq(from = 1, to = 5, by = 1)
```

We can use the last one to our advantage to extract the midterm years, which go by 2

```{r}
mean(turnout$newVEPturnout[c(2,4,6,8,10,12)]) # is the same as

mean(turnout$newVEPturnout[seq(2, 12, 2)])
```

Not a big deal now, but imagine if you had to write 100 numbers or 1 MILLION NUMBERS!

In this section, we have described voter turnout using multiple measures and types of elections. There are several other questions that political scientists may be interested in when it comes to voter turnout.

For example, Texas and more than a dozen other states have passed new laws that change voting procedures in elections. What effect will these have on voter turnout? In the next section, we start to examine how to evaluate causal claims.
