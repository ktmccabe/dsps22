    "text": "This document will include important links and course notes for 01:790:391:01: Data Science for Political Science for the fall 2022 semester.\n\nThis site will be updated throughout the semester with new content.\nThe Canvas modules will provide links to the relevant sections to review for a given week of the course.\nThe primary text for the course is Quantitative Social Science: An Introduction by Kosuke Imai. We will refer to this as QSS in the notes.\nThis is a new and living document. If you spot errors or have questions or suggestions, please email me at k.mccabe@rutgers.edu or post to the course Canvas site.\nOccasionally the notes are updated with embedded video explainers of the code in different sections.\n\n\n\nFirst: What is Data Science?\n\nData Science involves a combination of math/statistics and programming/coding skills, which, for our purposes, we will combine with social science knowledge.\n\nDrew Conway has a nice venn diagram of how these different skill sets intersect.\nNote: This course will not assume prior familiarity with data science in general or coding, specifically. For those brand new to data science, the idea of learning to code may seem intimidating, but anyone can succeed with a bit of patience and an open mind.\n\n\n\nNext: What is political science?\n\nThe science of politics, of course! Politics focuses on studying governance and the distribution of power in society, broadly conceived.\n\nHow else might you define politics and political science? What do we study in political science?\n\n\n\n\nExample: Mapping poverty using mobile phone and satellite data\nResearchers used modern data sources, including mobile phone data, as a way to predict and describe poverty in different geographic regions. These tools helped social scientists come up with methods that are much more cost-effective and efficient, but still as accurate as traditional methods for this type of measurement.\n\nHow might measures of global poverty be useful to political scientists?\n\n\nSocial Science Goals\nWe have several goals in social science. Here are four that data science can help us pursue:\n\nDescribe and measure\n\nHas the U.S. population increased?\n\nExplain, evaluate, and recommend (study of causation)\n\nDoes expanding Medicaid improve health outcomes?\n\nPredict\n\nWho will win the next election?\n\nDiscover\n\nHow do policies diffuse across states?\n\n\nWhat are other examples of these goals?\nNote: In this course, we are exploiting the benefits of quantitative data to help achieve goals of social science. However, quantitative data have their shortcomings, too. We will also discuss the limitations of various applications of social science data, and we encourage you to always think critically about how we are using data.\n\n\n\nThis course will provide you with a taste of each of these social science goals, and how the use of data can help achieve these goals. By the end of the course, you should be able to\n\nProvide examples of how quantitative data may be used to help answer social science research questions.\nCompare and contrast the goals of description, causation, prediction, and discovery in social science research.\nUse the programming language R to import and explore social science data and conduct basic statistical analyses.\nInterpret and describe visual displays of social science data, such as graphs and maps.\nDevelop your own analyses and visualizations to understand social science phenomena.\n\nIf you are someone that loves data, we hope you will find this course engaging. If you are someone who loathes or finds the idea of working with data and statistics alarming, we hope you keep an open mind. We will meet you where you are. This course will not assume knowledge of statistical software, and there will be plenty of opportunities to ask questions and seek help from classmates and the instructor throughout the semester.\nThe first section of course will walk people through how to use the statistical program– R– that we will employ this semester.\nWill this course help me in the future?\nEven if you do not plan on becoming a social scientist or a data scientist, an introduction to these skills may prove helpful throughout your academic and professional careers.\n\nTo become an informed consumer of news articles and research involving quantitative analyses.\nTo practice analytical thinking to make informed arguments and decisions.\nTo expand your toolkit for getting a job that may involve consuming or performing some data analysis, even if that is not the traditional role.\n\nExample: Journalism- How 5 Data Dynamos Do Their Jobs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoal\nBy the end of the first week of the course, you will want to have R and RStudio installed on your computer (both free) and feel comfortable using R as a calculator.\nR is an application that processes the R programming language in a statistical computing environment. RStudio is also an application, which serves as a user interface that makes working in R easier. We will primarily open and use RStudio to work with R.\nIn other classes, you may come across Stata, SPSS, Excel, or SAS, which are programs that also conduct data analysis. R has the advantage of being free and open-source. Even after you leave the university setting, you will be able to use R/RStudio for free. As an open-source program, it is very flexible, and a community of active R/RStudio users is constantly adding to and improving the program.\nR and RStudio Installation\nThis content follows and reinforces QSS 1.3. Additional resources are also linked below.\n\nThis video from Professor Christopher Bail explains why many social scientists use R and describes the R and RStudio installation process. This involves\n\nGoing to cran, select the link that matches your operating system, and then follow the installation instructions, and\nVisiting RStudio and follow the download and installation instructions. R is the statistical software and programming language used for analysis. RStudio provides a convenient user interface for running R code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis next section provides a few notes on using R and RStudio now that you have installed it. In this section, we cover the following materials:\n\nUsing R as a calculator and assigning objects using <-\nSetting your working directory and the setwd() function.\nCreating and saving an R script\n\nThis section highlights important concepts from QSS chapter 1.\n\n\nRStudio is an open-source and free program that greatly facilitates the use of R, especially for users new to programming. Once you have downloaded and installed R and RStudio, to work in R, all you need to do now is open RStudio (it will open R). It should look like this, though your version numbers will be different:\n\nNote: The first time you open RStudio, you likely only have the three windows above. We will want to create a fourth window by opening an R script to create the fourth window.\n\nTo do this, in RStudio, click on File -> New -> R script in your computer’s toolbar. This will open a blank document for text editing in the upper left of the RStudio window. We will return to this window in a moment.\n\nYou can alternatively click on the green + sign indicator in the top-left corner of the RStudio window, which should give you the option to create a new R script document.\n\n\nNow you should have something that looks like this, similar to Figure 1.1. in QSS:\nNote: The first time you open RStudio, you likely only have the three windows above. We will want to create a fourth window by opening an R script to create the fourth window.\n\nTo do this, in RStudio, click on File -> New -> R script in your computer’s toolbar. This will open a blank document for text editing in the upper left of the RStudio window. We will return to this window in a moment.\n\nYou can alternatively click on the green + sign indicator in the top-left corner of the RStudio window, which should give you the option to create a new R script document.\n\n\nNow you should have something that looks like this, similar to Figure 1.1. in QSS:\n\n\nThe upper-left window has our script document that will contain code.\nThe lower-left window is the console. This will show the output of the code we run. We will also be able to type directly in the console.\nThe upper-right window shows the environment (and other tabs, such as the history of commands). When we load and store data in RStudio, we will see a summary of that in the environment.\nThe lower-right window will enable us to view plots and search help files, among other things.\n\n\n\n\nThe bottom left window in your RStudio is the Console. You can type in this window to use R as a calculator or to try out commands. It will show the raw output of any commands you type. For example, we can try to use R as a calculator. Type the following in the Console (the bottom left window) and hit “enter” or “return” on your keyboard:\n\n5 + 3\n\n[1] 8\n\n5 - 3\n\n[1] 2\n\n5^2\n\n[1] 25\n\n5 * 3\n\n[1] 15\n\n5/3\n\n[1] 1.666667\n\n(5 + 3) * 2\n\n[1] 16\n\n\nIn the other RStudio windows, the upper right will show a history of commands that you have sent from the text editor to the R console, along with other items. The lower right will show graphs, help documents and other features. These will be useful later in the course.\n\n\n\nEarlier, I asked you to open an R script in the upper left window by doing File, then New File, then R Script. Let’s go back to working in that window.\nSet your working directory setwd()\n(Almost) every time you work in RStudio, the first thing you will do is set your working directory. This is a designated folder in your computer where you will save your R scripts and datasets.\nThere are many ways to do this.\n\nAn easy way is to go to Session -> Set Working Directory -> Choose Directory. I suggest choosing a folder in your computer that you can easily find and that you will routinely use for this class. Go ahead and create/select it.\nNote: when you selected your directory, code came out in the bottom left Console window. This is the setwd() command which can also be used directly to set your working directory in the future.\nIf you aren’t sure where your directory has been set, you can also type getwd() in your Console. Try it now\n\n\n## Example of where my directory was\ngetwd()\n\nIf I want to change the working directory, I can go to the top toolbar of my computer and use Session -> Set Working Directory -> Choose Directory or just type my file pathway using the setwd() below:\n\n## Example of setting the working directory using setwd().\n## Your computer will have your own file path.\nsetwd(\"/Users/ktmccabe/Dropbox/Rutgers Teaching/\")\n\nSaving the R Script\nLet’s now save our R script to our working directory and give it an informative name. To do so, go to File, then Save As, make sure you are in the same folder on your computer as the folder you chose for your working directory.\nGive the file an informative name, such as: “McCabeWeek1.R”. Note: all of your R scripts will have the .R extension.\n\n\n\nNow that we have saved our R script, let’s work inside of it. Remember, we are in the top-left RStudio window now.\n\nJust like the beginning of a paper, you will want to title your R script. In R, any line that you start with a # will not be treated as a programming command. You can use this to your advantage to write titles/comments. Below is a screenshot example of a template R script.\nYou can specify your working directory at the top, too. Add your own filepath inside setwd()\n\n\n\nThen you can start answering problems in the rest of the script.\nThink of the R script as where you write the final draft of your paper. In the Console (the bottom-left window), you can mess around and try different things, like you might when you are taking notes or outlining an essay. Then, write the final programming steps that lead you to your answer in the R script. For example, if I wanted to add 5 + 3, I might try different ways of typing it in the Console, and then when I found out 5 + 3 is the right approach, I would type that into my script.\n\n\n\n\nThe last thing we will note in this initial handout is how to execute commands in your R script.\nTo run / execute a command in your R script (the upper left window), you can\n\nHighlight the code you want to run, and then hold down “command + return” on a Mac or “control + enter” on Windows\nPlace your cursor at the end of the line of code (far right), and hit “command + return” on a Mac or “control + return” on Windows, or\nDo 1 or 2, but instead of using the keyboard to execute the commands, click “Run” in the top right corner of the upper-left window.\n\nTry it: Type 5 + 3 in the R script. Then, try to execute 5 + 3. It should look something like this:\n\nAfter you executed the code, you should see it pop out in your Console:\n\n5 + 3\n\n[1] 8\n\n\n\nNote: The symbol # also allows for annotation behind commands or on a separate line. Everything that follows # will be ignored by R. You can annotate your own code so that you and others can understand what each part of the code is designed to do.\n\n## Example\nsum53 <- 5 + 3 # example of assigning an addition calculation\n\n\n\n\nSometimes we will want to store our calculations as “objects” in R. We use <- to assign objects by placing it to the left of what we want to store. For example, let’s store the calculation 5 + 3 as an object named sum53:\n\nsum53 <- 5 + 3\n\nAfter we execute this code, sum53 now stores the calculation. This means, that if we execute a line of code that just hassum53`, it will output 8. Try it:\n\nsum53\n\n[1] 8\n\n\nNow we no longer have to type 5 + 3, we can just type sum53. For example, let’s say we wanted to subtract 2 from this calculation. We could do:\n\nsum53 - 2\n\n[1] 6\n\n\nLet’s say we wanted to divide two stored calculations:\n\nten <- 5 + 5\ntwo <- 1 + 1\nten / two\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nThe information stored does not have to be numeric. For example, it can be a word, or what we would call a character string, in which case you need to use quotation marks.\n\nmccabe <- \"professor for this course\"\nmccabe\n\n[1] \"professor for this course\"\n\n\nNote: Object names cannot begin with numbers and no spacing is allowed. Avoid using special characters such as % and $, which have specific meanings in R. Finally, use concise and intuitive object names.\n\nGOOD CODE: practice.calc <- 5 + 3\nBAD CODE: meaningless.and.unnecessarily.long.name <- 5 + 3\n\nWhile these are simple examples, we will use objects all the time for more complicated things to store (e.g., like full datasets!) throughout the course.\nWe can also store an array or “vector” of information using c()\n\nsomenumbers <- c(3, 6, 8, 9)\nsomenumbers\n\n[1] 3 6 8 9\n\n\nImportance of Clean Code\nIdeally, when you are done with your R script, you should be able to highlight the entire script and execute it without generating any error messages. This means your code is clean. Code with typos in it may generate a red error message in the Console upon execution. This can happen when there are typos or commands are misused.\nFor example, R is case sensitive. Let’s say we assigned our object like before:\n\nsum53 <- 5 + 3\n\nHowever, when we went to execute sum53, we accidentally typed Sum53:\n\nSum53\n\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'Sum53' not found\n\n\nOnly certain types of objects can be used in mathematical calculations. Let’s say we tried to divide mccabe by 2:\n\nmccabe / 2\n\nError in mccabe/2: non-numeric argument to binary operator\n\n\nA big part of learning to use R will be learning how to troubleshoot and detect typos in your code that generate error messages.\n\n\n\n\nBelow is an exercise that will demonstrate you are able to use R as a calculator and create R scripts, as well as locate important course platforms.\nWe will walk through this assignment together during class, but you are welcome to try to do this ahead of time on your own. You will submit, on Canvas, two documents prior to the deadline.\n\nAn R script (.R) file with your code. Follow the best practices by titling your script and using # comments to explain your steps. This code should be clean. I should be able to run your code to verify that the code produces the answers you write down.\nA Word document / Google Docs document or pdf with answers to the written questions (Problems 3-6 below). This document should also have a title with your name on it.\n\nYou may also alternatively submit a compiled RMarkdown document. We will discuss what RMarkdown is during class.\n\n\nAssignment Exercises\n\nCreate an R script saved as ``LastnameSetup1.R” (use your last name). Within the R script, follow the example from this handout and title the script.\nSet your working directory, and include the file pathway (within setwd()) at the top of your .R script.\nDo the calculation 8 + 3 - 2 in R. Store it as an object with an informative name. Report the answer.\nDo the calculation 5 x 3 in R. Store it as an object with an informative name. Report the answer.\nAdd these two calculations together. Note: do this by adding together the objects you created, not the underlying raw calculations. Report the answer.\nWrite down how you will complete your R assignments this semester. For example, if you have a personal laptop with R and RStudio on it, you will simply write “I will use my personal laptop.” If you don’t have a personal computer or laptop, please indicate where on campus or off-campus you will have regular access to a computer with R/RStudio to do your work. It is essential that you have regular access to a computer so that you will not fall behind in this course.\nNavigate to the course Piazza site and post a message. This can be as simple as “hello” or a reply to another person’s post. (No need to report this in your submission.)\n\n\n\n\nAn R Markdown document, which you can create in RStudio, allows you to weave together regular text, R code, and the output of R code in the same document. This can be very convenient when conducting data analysis because it allows you more space to explain what you are doing in each step. It can also be an effective platform for writing a report on a data analysis, similar to what you do when you write up a problem set.\nNote: RMarkdown is not required for this course. It is up to you if you would like to write your problem sets in RMarkdown\nR Markdown documents can be “compiled” into html, pdf, or docx documents. Below is an example of what a compiled html file looks like.\n\nNote that the image has both written text and a gray chunk, within which there is some R code, as well as the output of the R code (e.g., the number 8 and the image of the histogram plot)\n\n\n\n\nWe say this is a “compiled” RMarkdown document because it differs from the raw version of the file, which is a .Rmd file format. Below is an example of what the raw .Rmd version looks like, compared to the compiled html version."

Surveying people about their opinions on how the country doing is a common way that social scientists use description. We could extend this exercise in many ways going forward, even with the same question.\n\nStart with a question: How is the economy doing?\nLet’s find a measure: Ask people if the economy is doing well.\nFind data points: Multiple people (we could stop there with the average!), or add more variables:\n\nAcross time: Survey people across multiple years\nAcross type of people: Survey different partisan groups\n\n\nThese types of survey trends are often used by news organizations and public opinion organizations like, Gallup.\n\nThis was just a first example of description in political science. There are many other ways to describe how the economy is doing and many other topics we might want to describe in politics."

This makes the VEP denominator smaller than the VAP.\n\nVoter Turnout in the U.S.\n\nNumerator: total: Total votes cast (in thousands)\nDenominator:\n\nVAP: (voting-age population) from Census\nVEP (voting-eligible population) VEP = VAP + overseas voters - ineligible voters\n\nAdditional Variables and Descriptions\n\nyear: election year\nANES: ANES self-reported estimated turnout rate\nVEP: Voting Eligible Population (in thousands)\nVAP: Voting Age Population (in thousands)\ntotal: total ballots cast for highest office (in thousands)\nfelons: total ineligible felons (in thousands)\nnoncitizens: total non-citizens (in thousands)\noverseas: total eligible overseas voters (in thousands)\nosvoters: total ballots counted by overseas voters (in thousands)\n\n\n\n\n2.4.3 Getting to know your data\n\n## How many observations (the rows)?\nnrow(turnout)\n\n[1] 14\n\n## How many variables (the columns)?\nncol(turnout)\n\n[1] 9\n\n## What are the variable names?\nnames(turnout)\n\n[1] \"year\"     \"VEP\"      \"VAP\"      \"total\"    \"ANES\"     \"felons\"   \"noncit\"  \n[8] \"overseas\" \"osvoters\"\n\n## Show the first six rows\nhead(turnout)\n\n  year    VEP    VAP total ANES felons noncit overseas osvoters\n1 1980 159635 164445 86515   71    802   5756     1803       NA\n2 1982 160467 166028 67616   60    960   6641     1982       NA\n3 1984 167702 173995 92653   74   1165   7482     2361       NA\n4 1986 170396 177922 64991   53   1367   8362     2216       NA\n5 1988 173579 181955 91595   70   1594   9280     2257       NA\n6 1990 176629 186159 67859   47   1901  10239     2659       NA\n\n\nExtract a particular column (vector) from the data using the $.\n\nturnout$year\n\n [1] 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2008\n\n\nExtract the 10th year.

Go ahead, View() it\n\nView(turnout)\n\nThis does not change the underlying turnout.csv file, only the turnout data.frame we are working with in the current R session.\n\nThis is an advantage of using an R script.\nYou don’t have to worry about overwriting/messing up the raw data.\nYou start from the original raw data when you load turnout.csv, and then everything else is done within R.\n\nThis is our new denominator. Now we can calculate turnout based on this denominator.\n\nturnout$newVAPturnout <- turnout$total / turnout$VAPplusoverseas\n\nJust like with adding two vectors, when we divide, each value in the first vector is divided by its corresponding value in the second vector.\n\nturnout$newVAPturnout\n\n [1] 0.5203972 0.4024522 0.5253748 0.3607845 0.4972260 0.3593884 0.5404097\n [8] 0.3803086 0.4753376 0.3483169 0.4934211 0.3582850 0.5454777 0.5567409\n\n\nLet’s calculate the VEP turnout rate and turn it into a percentage. This time, we do it in one step.\n\n(total votes / VEP) \\(\\times\\) 100:\n\n\nturnout$newVEPturnout <- (turnout$total / turnout$VEP) * 100\nturnout$newVEPturnout\n\n [1] 54.19551 42.13701 55.24860 38.14115 52.76848 38.41895 58.11384 41.12625\n [9] 51.65793 38.09316 54.22449 39.51064 60.10084 61.55433\n\n\nLet’s change it from a proportion to a percentage. How? Multiply each value of turnout$newVAP by 100\n\nturnout$newVAPturnout <- turnout$newVAPturnout * 100\n\nThis multiplies each number within the vector by 100.\n\nturnout$newVAPturnout\n\n [1] 52.03972 40.24522 52.53748 36.07845 49.72260 35.93884 54.04097 38.03086\n [9] 47.53376 34.83169 49.34211 35.82850 54.54777 55.67409\n\n\nWhat is typical turnout?\n\nmean(turnout$newVAPturnout)\n\n[1] 45.45658\n\nmean(turnout$newVEPturnout)\n\n[1] 48.94937\n\n\nWe find that turnout based on the voting age population is lower than turnout based on the voting eligible population. This is a pattern that political scientists have examined, going back several decades. For example, in a 2001 article McDonald and Popkin show that is it the ineligible population that grew from the 1970s onward and not the population of people who simply prefer not to vote.

    "text": "2.6 Comparing Presidential vs. Midterm turnout\nHow does turnout compare in presidential vs. midterm years? Sometimes using a single summary of turnout may obscure important underlying differences in the data. To detect these differences, we may want to summarize different parts of the data.\nOh dear. We need to extract specific years from the turnout data frame. Which rows contain the years we want?\n\nturnout$year\n\n [1] 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2008\n\n\nOk: rows 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,14 are the presidential. And rows 2,4,6,8,10,12 are midterms.\n\n## we can extract all of these at once by using c()\nturnout$year[c(1,3,5,7,9,11,13,14)] # presidential\n\n[1] 1980 1984 1988 1992 1996 2000 2004 2008\n\n\nLet’s take the mean VEP turnout for presidential years.\n\nmean(turnout$newVEPturnout[c(1,3,5,7,9,11,13,14)])\n\n[1] 55.983\n\n\nLet’s take the mean VEP turnout for midterm years.\n\nmean(turnout$newVEPturnout[c(2,4,6,8,10,12)])\n\n[1] 39.5712\n\n\nLet’s take the difference by storing each mean and then subtracting\n\nmean.VEP.pres <- mean(turnout$newVEPturnout[c(1,3,5,7,9,11,13,14)])\nmean.VEP.mid <- mean(turnout$newVEPturnout[c(2,4,6,8,10,12)])\nmean.VEP.pres -  mean.VEP.mid\n\n[1] 16.41181\n\n\nPresidential turnout, on average, is higher than midterm turnout.\n\n2.6.1 R shortcut for writing vectors\nSometimes we write numbers that are in a predictable sequence (e.g., 1,2,3,4,5). In R, we have functions that prevent us from having to type each number when this is the case.\n\nc(1,2,3,4,5) # is equivalent to:\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\n1:5 # is equivalent to:\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\nseq(from = 1, to = 5, by = 1)\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\n\nWe can use the last one to our advantage to extract the midterm years, which go by 2\n\nmean(turnout$newVEPturnout[c(2,4,6,8,10,12)]) # is the same as\n\n[1] 39.5712\n\nmean(turnout$newVEPturnout[seq(2, 12, 2)])\n\n[1] 39.5712\n\n\nNot a big deal now, but imagine if you had to write 100 numbers or 1 MILLION NUMBERS!\nIn this section, we have described voter turnout using multiple measures and types of elections. There are several other questions that political scientists may be interested in when it comes to voter turnout.\nFor example, Texas and more than a dozen other states have passed new laws that change voting procedures in elections. What effect will these have on voter turnout? In the next section, we start to examine how to evaluate causal claims."
