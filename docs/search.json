We will refer to this as QSS in the notes.\nThis is a new and living document. If you spot errors or have questions or suggestions, please email me at k.mccabe@rutgers.edu or post to the course Canvas site.\nOccasionally the notes are updated with embedded video explainers of the code in different sections.\n\n\n\nFirst: What is Data Science?\n\nData Science involves a combination of math/statistics and programming/coding skills, which, for our purposes, we will combine with social science knowledge.\n\nDrew Conway has a nice venn diagram of how these different skill sets intersect.\nNote: This course will not assume prior familiarity with data science in general or coding, specifically. For those brand new to data science, the idea of learning to code may seem intimidating, but anyone can succeed with a bit of patience and an open mind."
