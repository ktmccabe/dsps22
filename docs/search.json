Our concepts are rich, while our measures may be very narrow or concrete.\n\nFor example, GDP is one way to measure economic health, but is it the only measure?\nChoose measures based on validity, reliability, cost\n\n\nFind multiple relevant units or “data points”\n\nE.g., Multiple years of data (e.g., U.S., from 1900 to 2020)\nE.g., Multiple countries from one year (e.g., U.S. to Germany to other countries)\n\nSummarize the data to help answer the question\n\n\n2.1.1 Example Process\n\nHow is the economy doing?\nFind outcome data relevant to that question\n\nLet’s ask people\n\nFind multiple relevant units or data points\n\nWe will ask several people. Each person will be a data point.\n\nSummarize the data\n\nLet’s take the mean\n\n\n\nHow would you summarize information in explaining it to another person? You would probably want to describe how most people feel about the economy. In other words, you would describe the “central tendency” of people’s responses (the central tendency of the data)."

Note: when a variable contains only 0’s and 1’s its mean is the proportion of 1’s. 40% of people think the economy is doing well.\n\n2.3.1 Using functions in R (overview)\nA function is an action(s) that you request R to perform on an object or set of objects. For example, we will use the mean() function to ask R to take the mean or “average” of a vector.\n\nInside the function you place inputs or “arguments.”\n\n\nmean(Outcome)\n\n[1] 0.4\n\n\nR also has functions that take the sum sum() of a vector of values.\n\nsumofvalues <- sum(Outcome)\n\nAnd that count the total number of values or “length” length() of the vector.\n\nnumberofvalues <- length(Outcome)\n\nNote that the below is also equivalent to the mean\n\nsumofvalues / numberofvalues\n\n[1] 0.4\n\n\nReturning to our example, we found that 40% of people surveyed thought the economy was doing well. Surveying people about their opinions on how the country doing is a common way that social scientists use description. We could extend this exercise in many ways going forward, even with the same question.\n\nStart with a question: How is the economy doing?\nLet’s find a measure: Ask people if the economy is doing well.\nFind data points: Multiple people (we could stop there with the average!), or add more variables:\n\nAcross time: Survey people across multiple years\nAcross type of people: Survey different partisan groups\n\n\nThese types of survey trends are often used by news organizations and public opinion organizations like, Gallup.\n\nThis was just a first example of description in political science. There are many other ways to describe how the economy is doing and many other topics we might want to describe in politics."

In R, we have functions that prevent us from having to type each number when this is the case.\n\nc(1,2,3,4,5) # is equivalent to:\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\n1:5 # is equivalent to:\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\nseq(from = 1, to = 5, by = 1)\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\n\nWe can use the last one to our advantage to extract the midterm years, which go by 2\n\nmean(turnout$newVEPturnout[c(2,4,6,8,10,12)]) # is the same as\n\n[1] 39.5712\n\nmean(turnout$newVEPturnout[seq(2, 12, 2)])\n\n[1] 39.5712\n\n\nNot a big deal now, but imagine if you had to write 100 numbers or 1 MILLION NUMBERS!\nIn this section, we have described voter turnout using multiple measures and types of elections. There are several other questions that political scientists may be interested in when it comes to voter turnout.\nFor example, Texas and more than a dozen other states have passed new laws that change voting procedures in elections. What effect will these have on voter turnout? In the next section, we start to examine how to evaluate causal claims."
